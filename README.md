#  Contact Learning Hours in Further Education and Sixth Form Colleges

**Author:** Siddik Shaik  

## Overview
This project analyses contact learning hours, gender distribution, and institutional performance across **Further Education (FE)** and **Sixth Form Colleges** in the UK. Statistical and data mining techniques are applied to understand how educational intensity and institutional characteristics influence student outcomes.

## Objective
To evaluate the impact of contact learning hours, gender distribution, and institution size on graduation rates and value-added performance metrics in UK colleges.

## Methodology
- Data analysis performed using **SAS**
- Data import and anomaly detection using PROC IMPORT and PROC MEANS  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PROC SGPLOT  
- Institution classification based on contact hours per learner  
- Statistical modelling using:
  - ANOVA
  - Logistic Regression
  - Clustering techniques  

## Data Sources
- Sixth Form Colleges dataset  
- Further Education (FE) Colleges dataset  
- FE Performance Metrics dataset  

## Analysis Performed
- Distribution analysis of contact learning hours per learner  
- Relationship analysis between gender composition and contact hours  
- Institution size classification (Small, Medium, Large)  
- ANOVA analysis on graduation pass rate and value-added factor  
- Logistic regression to predict graduation outcomes  
- Clustering to group institutions based on learning intensity and demographics  

## Key Findings
- Significant variation in contact learning hours across institutions and regions  
- No strong correlation between gender distribution and contact learning hours  
- Contact learning hours and institutional characteristics influence graduation rates  
- Clustering reveals distinct institutional patterns in educational delivery  

## Tools & Techniques
SAS · Statistical Analysis · ANOVA · Logistic Regression · Clustering · Data Visualization  

## Conclusion
The study highlights meaningful differences in educational intensity and performance across UK colleges. The findings support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation and institutional improvement to enhance student outcomes.
